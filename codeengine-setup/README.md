# Deploy the Application to Code Engine

**NOTE:** Before deploying, ensure you have space in the designated container registry. These steps assume images will be stored in `us.icr.io`. To determine this, go to [https://cloud.ibm.com/containers/registry/images](https://cloud.ibm.com/containers/registry/images), choose **Settings** from lefthand menu, select the region from the drop-down menu, in this case choose `Dallas`. This will show you the remaining space.  You may need to upgrade to the paid plan if planning to develop this application and save more than one image. See [Container Registry Overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) for more details.

## Using Terraform Scripts (only if code resides in public github.com repository)

To deploy using Terraform, see [Deploy the RAG LLM Application to Code Engine using Terraform](./terraform/README.md)

## Manual method

To deploy manually, see [Deploy the RAG LLM Application into Code Engine step by step](./manual-setup.md)
  
## Accessing the URL on Code Engine

Wait for the build to complete. To access the URL go into the **Applications** page within the Code Engine Project, and click the **OpenURL** link next to the newly deployed `rag-app` application

A quick sanity check with `<url>/docs` will take you to the swagger ui. To try the APIs from swagger, you will need to click the **Authorize** button at the top and add the value you set for RAG-APP-API-KEY in the environment variables

## How to see the logs from Code Engine containers

If your RAG-LLM API calls produce an error, take a look at the container logs. The easiest way to see the logs from the application containers running on Code Engine is to use the `ibmcloud` command line interface. You will need to install the IBM Cloud CLI along with the Code Engine plugin.  See [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) and [Code Engine CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/containers/serverless/cli) :

```
ibmcloud login -sso
ibmcloud plugin install code-engine
ibmcloud target -g <resource group containing Code Engine project>
ibmcloud ce project list
ibmcloud ce project select -n <ce project name>
ibmcloud ce app list
ibmcloud ce application logs -f -n <ce app name>
```
